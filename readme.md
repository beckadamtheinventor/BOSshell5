## Cesium

Cesium is the first *shell* for the TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculators, and includes many useful features.

### Installing

In order to transfer Cesium to your calculator, you must have a linking program, such as TI-Connect CE: https://education.ti.com/ticonnectce. Once installed:

1. Plug-in your calculator and Launch TI-Connect CE
2. Send `cesium.8xp` (or `cesium_french.8xp` if needed)
3. Drag'n'drop them onto the calculator that should be in the devices list in TI-Connect CE
4. Press the <kbd>Send</kbd> button in the window that pops up.

Congratulations, Cesium is now on your calculator!

### Running
For the first run, execute Cesium as you would any other assembly program by pressing <kbd>2nd</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd> and choosing the `Asm(` token.
Then press <kbd>prgm</kbd> and choose `CESIUM`. The homescreen should look like this:

    Asm(prgmCESIUM

*If you have OS 5.3 or above, you can just do:*

    prgmCESIUM

Press <kbd>enter</kbd> to execute.

**NOTE:** The `Cesium` application is accessible with the <kbd>apps</kbd> button; *not* with the <kbd>prgm</kbd> button.

Once installed, the application cannot be transferred to other calculators. If you wish to transfer Cesium to other calculators after installation, you must transfer the installer itself to other calculators.

### Controls
Cesium provides a way to quickly jump to different programs in the program browser. Simply press one of the keys with a green letter above it, and it will take you to the first program with that starts with that letter.

| Combination     | Action                                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>2nd</kbd> / <kbd>enter</kbd> | Run, select              |
| <kbd>alpha</kbd>                  | Edit program options     |
| <kbd>zoom</kbd>                   | Edit BASIC program       |
| <kbd>y=</kbd>                     | Create new BASIC program |
| <kbd>graph</kbd>                  | Rename program / appvar  |
| <kbd>mode</kbd>                   | Enter settings menu      |
| <kbd>up</kbd> / <kbd>down</kbd>   | Move places              |
| <kbd>green letters</kbd>          | Alpha search for program |

### Shortcuts
Shortcuts are available from the TI-OS system anywhere. Simply hold the <kbd>on</kbd> key and press the corresponding button to trigger the action.
Available actions:

| Combination | Action                                                                      |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>on</kbd> + <kbd>prgm</kbd>  | Launch Cesium Application                              |
| <kbd>on</kbd> + <kbd>stat</kbd>  | Power down with password on wake (No Default Password) |
| <kbd>on</kbd> + <kbd>graph</kbd> | Open label jumper in TI-Basic Editor                   |

The label jumper is a handy feature for those editing Basic or ICE programs, and allows quick navigation to any label listed in the program.

You can change the password from the settings menu (Accessed using <kbd>mode</kbd>), and pressing the <kbd>stoâ†’</kbd> button. This will prompt for a new password which will be automatically saved. 
*Note: There is no default password as before.*

### External Backup
Cesium also offers the ability to externally back up the RAM from within the OS. These are also tied to the shortcuts:

**THE FLASH CHIP IS ONLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT 100,000+ ERASE CYCLES. PLEASE BE SURE TO MODERATE USEAGE.**

| Combination | Action                                                     |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <kbd>on</kbd> + <kbd>8</kbd>    | Backup RAM from TI-OS                  |
| <kbd>on</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>    | Remove latest RAM backup               |
| <kbd>on</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>    | Restore RAM from latest backup         |

### Running Programs
Cesium can run programs written in ASM, C, ICE, or BASIC, either from the archive or not. It is prefered that you place programs in the archive, as it will protect them against RAM clears.
To run a program, simply press <kbd>2nd</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>. After a program is finished running, it will return to Cesium.
Note: pressing <kbd>2nd</kbd> to back up RAM before running will only work if the "Backup RAM" option is enabled in the Cesium settings. Otherwise, the program will be run without backing up the RAM.

### Uninstalling 
<sup><sub>First off, why would you ever want to delete such an awesome shell?</sub></sup>

To uninstall Cesium, press <kbd>2nd</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> and delete the Cesium Application and appvar. Or you can delete anything Cesium from TI-Connect CE.

You can also delete the Cesium AppVar from Cesium, then delete the App itself.  Exit Cesium to finish.
NOTE: The "show special directories" box MUST be selected in order to see the AppVars/ Apps folder!!

### Building

Cesium uses submodules to build, so be sure to clone the project like so:
Go to a new folder, then run the following command(s):

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium.git

Download `fasmg` and place it in the root directory of the repository (Available for your OS near the bottom of [this page](https://flatassembler.net/download.php)), or add it to your global PATH variable.

Build Cesium using the following `make` commands, depending on what language you want:

    make
    make english
    make french
